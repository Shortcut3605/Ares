# Ares
My own language that I am making.
# MATH RULES

It only parses math expressions at the moment. Standard pemdas rules apply

#Variable Rules

var *name* = *value*

creates variable *name* with *value*. Reassigns *name* to *value* if *name* already exists. type does not matter.

# FIRST RUN MAKE and then (IF MAC OR LINUX ./ares OR WINDOWS ares.exe) AND PASS IN THE NAME OF THE FILE YOU WANT TO RUN.
# EXAMPLE: ./ares main.ares OR ares.exe main.ares
